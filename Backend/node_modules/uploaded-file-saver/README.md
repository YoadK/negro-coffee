# uploaded-file-saver

Saves, updates and deletes uploaded files to and from the hard drive.

## Installation:

```bash
npm i uploaded-file-saver
```

## Usage: 

- Config once a common containing folder for all files (note that on each save/update/delete you can specify a different folder than this one):
```typescript
import { fileSaver } from "uploaded-file-saver";
import path from "path";
fileSaver.config(path.join(__dirname, "..", "my-assets", "my-uploaded-files"));
```

- Save an uploaded file:
```typescript
const createdFileName = await fileSaver.add(myUploadedFile);
```

- Update existing file with a new uploaded one:
```typescript
const updatedFileName = await fileSaver.update(existingFileName, newUploadedFile);
```

- Delete existing file:
```typescript
await fileSaver.delete(existingFileName);
```

- Get existing file path:
```typescript
const filePath = fileSaver.getFilePath(existingFileName);
```

- Get a cool file-not-found path:
```typescript
const filePath = fileSaver.getFileNotFoundPath();
```
